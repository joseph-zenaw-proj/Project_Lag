People have always been programmed into thinking in a binary way and it is almost impossible to get out of that thinking. We either want something or we don't. It's always "Do you prefer a burger or a pizza?" not "What is your favorite fast food?".
After some part of our age we classify our lives into two. Work place and Home. We are either at work grinding and thinking about home or at home resting and thinking about work.
I don't want my life to have that structure. I hate home, but I also hate school. I like my friends but I don't like the environment I meet them in. I always envy those people hitting bars before going home. They somehow managed to get out of that binary structure. I want that. I NEED THAT.

It is so painful to even think about the fact that our routines don't even need our consciousness. Our subconscious mind takes control of this and we age without even being aware of what a 24 hours day looks like. We are not aware of our surroundings because we actually don't care about them.
We care about things we are told to care about. Which are being successful and being safe.
You have to work to be successful and you have to go home to be safe. But what about the part in the middle?

Going to college has always been an interesting subject for me because for once in my life I can actually do something without anyone's opinion. But my parents figured this about me and decided to send me to a private college that's 10 minutes walk from our house. Ever since they told me that I've been uninterested in life and bored pretty much everyday. Not just because they ruined my plan of being a free man but also because they thought that was better for me.

Alex (my bestfriend) feels the same way about life. He hates school like I do even though he is the highest scorer from his class. He has this saying "just because school sucks I don't have to suck at school". Which is right but that never worked for me. I'm always bored and not invested in the subjects I learn at school. Clair(my other best friend) on the other hand is passionate about school. She loves the environment, the teachers, the students, even the plants at school. Sure part of it is because her parents fight every day and night and she hates her home because it's a living hell. But the other reason is her being an extrovert.

Alex, Clair and I spend time together as much as we can. Before class starts, during our lunch break and during our commute to our homes. Those times are the only part of my days that make me feel alive and peaceful. Then it all ends and I go back to my room where boredom and depression is the main theme of. Of course it is my favorite part of our home but that's because it helps me avoid my parents and their boring conversations. They are amazing people, they're just not interesting, At least for me.  

Today is my birthday. Not that it matters to me but it kind of does. Anyone who tells you that they don't care about their birthday is lying to you. 
Alex got into the school bus with a smirk on his face. The last time I saw that face was when he stole an iPod from his cousin. So it either means he stole his console too or he got me a gift. I really wish it's the second one because Alex is so good at giving gifts.
He sat next to me panting and empty handed. Which means that he either wants to surprise me or the gift he prepared is too large to bring. Or he just forgot.
The first word that came out of his mouse was "I think I found a place". Which gave me goosebumps and unsettling feeling.

You see Alex , Clair and I have been looking for a place to hangout after school that won't require us to pay for services. A place we can be ourselves in. A place that feels like our own tiny world.
I couldn't believe what he said so I had to check.
"A place?" I asked.
"You know what I'm talking about." he replied.
I knew exactly what he was talking about. We couldn't say anything else because we didn't want other kids to hear about it. We were just too eager to tell Clair about it.
As soon as she got in both of us stood up and shouted her name, "CLAIR".
She seemed off. She always has such kind of face when she comes from home but this was a bit different. She walked right past us and sat behind our chair.
We knew something was wrong with her or her family so we had to check. We turned around and said two weird things to say at the same time.
"Wanna talk about it" I whispered.
"Who died?" Alex said.
I had to give him a slight pinch to take things easy since he doesn't know how to address these kind of scenarios.
He repeated what I said.
"Classic mom and dad fight.", Clair answered.
"But this one was more physical than ever."
You would think by saying that her father is abusive. It's actually the other way. Her mother beats her father every day and he always looks like he lost a UFC match.
Why don't they get a divorce? Well because they have an illegal business that they can't stop because it's making them insane amount of money. But Clair doesn't know that we know this.
As much as Clair says she doesn't care about her parents, she really does. She wants to have a healthy family. What extroverted nerd doesn't want that.
She would always mention how it would have felt to live inside our household and that I am lucky to have my parents around as just human beings let alone my parents.
Even though Alex can not handle these kind of situations he damn well knows how to make people laugh.
"Well look at the bright side, your mother is now less than 10 fights away from a domestic championship."
I couldn't hold my laughter and neither could Clair. 
That instantly lifted her mood up and she started talking about the movie she watched the night before.
I had to interrupt her because there is actually something more interesting to talk about than her movie reports.
"Alex found a place." I interrupted.
She stopped what she was saying and looked Alex straight to his eyes to confirm what I said.
Alex gave her a proud yes nod.
She stood up and started doing the dance she does when she is extremely happy.
Other students were looking at us in a weird and somehow envious way.
We got our shit together and finally arrived at school. For once in my life time I was smiling while walking to my class.
Before going to our classes we agreed to go and see the place after school. Then we got in and the day felt like a week. I spent every single second of the classes I took looking at the clock. And the last class ended and I stormed out of the room. They were the first ones to get out of their classes too and we started running to the gate as soon as we saw each other. We got out of the school compound and asked Alex where we are heading next. He told us to follow him and started running. We followed him like a mile and he started heading towards a medium sized farm , Clair looked back and said "what the fuck". I had the same thought in my head but we just kept on following him. He then stopped and said "we are here".
It caught both of us off guard and confused since there is nothing except a farm where we stood. 
"Alex are you out of your mind?" Clair shouted.
He laughed and said "Welcome to the third place" and jumped right into a puddle and disappeared.
Clair and I screamed and instantly thought that Alex is dead.
I couldn't say anything because I have this habit of not being able to speak when I am scared. Clair on the other hand kept shouting and screaming "HELP".
Then we heard a sound from God knows where saying "jump in you cowards what are you waiting for". Clair instantly stopped crying and decided to jump in. I tried my best to stop her but she was too damn fast. I kept the scared silence going until I heard Clair's voice saying "You have to jump Keith". 
Well even though hearing her sound put me at ease I still didn't want to jump in because for starters I can not swim and also THIS IS FREAKING WEIRD.
I decided to sprint to home and ask for help but while I was on my way I pictured what the conversation will look like and I knew for sure that no one would believe me. So I just decided to go back and jump right into that freaky puddle.
I was so wrong, the puddle wasn't just a puddle but it was a portal like entrance into a cave. It wasn't even that deep and there was nothing to be scared of.
As soon as I got into the cave Alex shouted "THAT'S MY BOY". I have never seen anything like this. It was everything I have ever wanted and more. I instantly felt like I was home which is a feeling that I never had.
